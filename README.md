# Social-Distancing-COVID-19-in-Real-Time-using-Object-Detection
This is the quarantine project on maintaing Social Distancing which is essential to stop spread of this deadly virus. I have analyzed object detection model yolov3 and ssd to detect whether the person is maintaining social distancing or not.

I have used SSD Object Detection Architecture to detect only Person Class and track them if there distance is not approximately 2m then Red Box appear; maintain distance safe then green box appear.
